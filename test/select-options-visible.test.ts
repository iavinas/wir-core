// A select's own options must be visible to the caller that has to choose one.
//
// This is the zero-tolerance class in CLAUDE.md — "the runtime saw it and did not
// show you" — and it was a contradiction inside this system. agent/loop.ts told the
// model to "enumerate the chooser's own options (find with role option over the
// select)", while core/compiler.ts documented that <option> elements are never
// compiled. The instruction named a query the compiler guaranteed to answer with
// nothing.
//
// Reproduced in the probe first, on the live shopping storefront
// (http://localhost:7770/sales/guest/form/, a two-option select):
//     find(role=option)   -> matched 0 of 117 searched
//     read(the select)    -> childrenTotal 0, children 0
//     page_ground_truth   -> contains "Email": true, "ZIP Code": true
// The oracle is a direct page.evaluate with no WIR in it, so that last line is the
// runtime being contradicted by the page itself.
//
// Found by driving five shopping_admin tasks with a strong model after a small one
// had spiralled on them. On task 201 find(role=option) matched 0 of 5977 and
// find(name="Suspected Fraud") matched 0, while the option demonstrably existed;
// only act(select) could reveal it. The strong model guessed past it. Its own note
// is why this matters: "a weaker model would read that empty find as 'there is no
// such status' and stop — which is very close to how the haiku run died."
//
// The options still get no refs. Inside a closed <select> they are genuinely not
// separately addressable and `act` selects by LABEL, so the labels travel on the
// select — the node the caller acts on — in BOTH find and read.
