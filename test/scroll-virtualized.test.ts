// `scroll` exists for exactly one thing — reaching content a page renders only
// as you scroll — and its verdict was decided by a signal that is constant on
// exactly that case.
//
// `newContent` tested a rising element count (`querySelectorAll('*').length`)
// or a growing `scrollHeight`. A virtualized list recycles a FIXED number of
// nodes behind a full-height spacer, so both are false while every row on
// screen is new. The act then answered `verified/scrolled_no_new_content`, and
// agent/loop.ts turns that token into "stop, and stop when it reports none" —
// so the model stops one viewport into a list it has never read.
//
// core/act.ts already documented both halves ("react-virtualized shows 50,000px
// of scroll extent behind 81 rendered children"; "a virtualized list sizes its
// scrollbar with a full-height spacer, so the obvious tell reads complete on
// exactly the case it was meant to catch") — and the verdict was still built on
// them.
//
// FIXTURE JUSTIFIED: the condition is a scroller whose node count and
// scrollHeight are both pinned while its text changes. No real site can be asked
// to hold that still, and the recorded corpus has no virtualized page. One page,
// one proven condition.
